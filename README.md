# tinystories-quickstart
A quick and easy way to train and evaluate performant TinyStories models.

This started from [Andrej Karpathy's NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt), slimmed it down to a single GPU and optimized it for quick training runs on [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759).

After 10 minutes of training on H100, the model completes "Lily went to the park and saw a friendly dog." with the the following compleition.

Lily went to the park and saw a friendly dog. The dog was wagging its tail and sniffing around a nice puddle. Lily realized that the water was clean and shiny. She started to dance around and make up a little song. The dog barked and joined in on the dance. Lily had so much fun playing with the dog and forgot about the time. 

As the sun began to set, Lily was sad to leave the park, but she knew she could come back again and dance with the dog again. She smiled and held on tight to the umbrella as she walked home.
